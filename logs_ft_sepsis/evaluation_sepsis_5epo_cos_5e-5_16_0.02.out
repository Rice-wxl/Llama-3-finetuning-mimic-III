Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening condition that happens when the body's immune system has an extreme response to an infection. It can be either severe sepsis, which is with acute organ dysfunction, or non-severe sepsis. It also includes septic shock, where a bacterial infection causes low blood pressure.\n    \n    *discharge summary report starts*\n    Admission Date:  [**2163-3-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2163-3-26**]\n\nDate of Birth:   [**2088-9-5**]     Sex:  M\n\nService:  CCU\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old male who\nwas originally admitted to care for hypoxia, hypertension,\nand mental status changes.  Reportedly, the patient had\nabrupt onset of dyspnea and was found to be hypoxic.  At\noutside hospital, the gas on 100% FIO2 of 85, pCO2 30, pH\n7.47 with a systolic blood pressure of 70.  He denies other\nsymptoms at that time.  Chest x-ray revealed extensive\nbilateral pulmonary disease consistent with lymphangitic\ncarcinomatosis and perhaps pulmonary edema.\n\nElectrocardiogram demonstrated inferior ST elevation and ST\ndepression in V2 and Q waves in the inferior leads.  He did\nhave a history of an old inferior myocardial infarction.\nTroponin-I peak at 1.92, peak CK at 210.  CT scan of the\nchest was negative for pulmonary embolus.  Echocardiogram\ndemonstrated ejection fraction of 50% with posterior wide\nhypokinesis, mild MR and mild TR.  He was then transferred to\nthe [**Hospital6 **], where he underwent catheterization\nrevealing 90% lesion in the mid right coronary artery with\nthrombus.  He was referred to [**Hospital1 188**] for PCI of the right coronary artery lesion.\n\nCatheterization here revealed 60-70% lesion in the mid circ\nand distal circ in addition to the right coronary artery\nlesion.  The right coronary artery lesion was stented in two\nplaces with much difficulty.\n\nIn the holding area, he was noted to have decreased mental\nstatus and increased confusion.  O2 sat was found to be 70%.\nHe was given Lasix, intravenous nitroglycerin, and placed on\n100% nonrebreather at which time his oxygen saturation\nimproved to 90-100%.  He was then transferred to the CCU for\nfurther evaluation.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals at that time included a heart\nrate of 58, blood pressure 132/61, respirations 19, and he\nwas 96% on nonrebreather.  He is a pleasant man in no acute\ndistress.  Pupils are small but reactive.  Heart:  He had a\nregular, rate, and rhythm with a II/VI crescendo systolic\nmurmur.  His lungs have bibasilar dry, rhonchorous, coarse\nthroughout especially in the lower lobe.  Abdomen was soft,\nnontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds with no\nhepatosplenomegaly.  He had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Metastatic prostate cancer with bone metastases to the\nright humeral.\n2. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction\nsix years ago treated with medical therapy.  A recent ETT\nshowed inferior fixed defects, ejection fraction of 50%.\n3. Hypertension.\n4. Zoster.\n5. High cholesterol.\n6. Status post appendectomy.\n\nHOME MEDICATIONS:\n1. Atenolol 50.\n2. Zocor.\n3. Neurontin.\n4. Vicodin.\n5. Levaquin.\n\nALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] positive\nalcohol 1-2 drinks.  He quit smoking tobacco 50 years ago.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  Hospital course is relatively\nuncomplicated.  He was admitted to CCU.  He was gently\ndiuresed with Lasix and intravenous nitroglycerin.  He was\ngradually weaned.  His oxygen was gradually weaned down to 2\nliters nasal cannula, however, there was not much improvement\nfollowing this intervention.  It was thought that his O2\nrequirement could possible be due to a primary pulmonary\nprocess that could have been lymphangitic carcinomatosis or\nfibrosis, perhaps from her Taxotere therapy.\n\nPatient was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells to\nmaintain his hematocrit above 30 with a recent coronary\nevent.  His laboratories on admission were 17.7, 32.4\nhematocrit, platelets 189.  Sodium 144, potassium 3.8,\nchloride 110, bicarb 21, BUN 42, creatinine 0.8, glucose 157,\ncalcium 8.7, magnesium 2.0, phosphorus 3.9.\n\nCardiovascular:  He had two stents placed to his RCA.  He was\ncontinued on Plavix, aspirin, beta blockers, and ACE\ninhibitor.  He was kept on Integrilin for 18 hours.\nReportedly at the outside hospital, the patient was found to\nhave an atypical pneumonia.  He was continued on Levaquin.\nHis QTC was monitored because of the prepencity of Levaquin\nto lengthen QTC.\n\nPatient was seen by Physical Therapy who said that he was\nsafe to be discharged home and recommended PT visit to\nmaximize rehabilitation.\n\nHe was discharged home in good condition after speaking with\nthe patient's oncologist with close followup to further\nworkup the primary lung process causing him to have a new\noxygen requirement.  The patient was discharged home with\nhome O2.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day x4 days.\n2. Simvastatin 2 mg po q day.\n3. Gabapentin 400 mg po bid.\n4. Protonix 40 mg po q day.\n5. Lasix 40 mg po q day.\n6. Atenolol 50 mg q am, 25 mg q pm.\n7. Aspirin 325 mg po q day.\n8. Home O2 by 2 liters nasal cannula continuous.\n9.

The infant was born at 18:42 on [**2109-12-16**]. The\nexact gestation dates are uncertain because the mother was\nnot aware that she was pregnant until approximately one month\nprior to delivery and had late onset of prenatal care. The\nmother is a 23 year old G1 P0, blood type B positive,\nantibody negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune, hepatitis\nB negative, GC negative, Chlamydia negative, GBS unknown.\nMother has a history of migraine headaches treated with\nnortriptyline. She is a Jehovah's witness. The pregnancy was\ncomplicated by anhydramnios of unclear duration and possible\nIUGR. The mother presented to [**Hospital3 **] for\nprenatal care. She was presumed to have ruptured membranes\nand transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].\nMother was started on ampicillin and erythromycin seven days\nprior to delivery. She had no fever, no signs of\nchorioamnionitis clinically.\n\nThe infant was born by stat C-section on [**12-16**] because of non-\nreassuring fetal heart rate tracing and prolonged fetal\ntachycardia. The infant emerged in a breech position with\nflexed hips, specifically the right leg more hyperextended\nand externally rotated. The infant was intubated in the\nDelivery Room. Apgar scores were 6 and 7. She was admitted to\nthe NICU.\n\nSUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The infant was placed on high\nfrequency ventilation. Over the course of the evening, she\nwas stable on high frequency ventilation. However, as of\napproximately 12 hours of age, she had deterioration in her\noxygenation. Her chest x-ray showed no air leak, consistent\nwith respiratory insufficiency, ET tube in good position. The\ninfant had very low oxygen saturations, at best in the 80's.\nAt this point, I discussed with the mother and father that\nthe child's prognosis was very poor. Upon receiving volume\nexpansion, she transiently had oxygen saturations in the\n90's, still on 100 percent FIO2 and mean airway pressures in\nthe 11-12 range. The infant was also initiated on\nindomethacin and dopamine for treatment of a patent ductus\narteriosus. The infant then had a repeat occurrence of\nprogressive desaturations that were unresponsive to hand\nbagging, switching to mechanical ventilation. The infant had\nprogressive deterioration in her cardiorespiratory status\ndespite maximal ventilatory support. There was further\ndiscussion with the family regarding the futility of\ncontinuing treatment in an infant who is having no response\nto maximal ventilatory support in terms of oxygenation. The\netiology of her respiratory failure is thought to be related\nto her extreme prematurity and potential pulmonary hypoplasia\ngiven the mother's several day interval of prolonged ruptured\nmembranes and oligohydramnios. The infant had ventilatory\nsupport withheld as of 1400 hours on [**2109-12-17**]. The infant\nwas pronounced dead by [**Doctor First Name **] Zacharini, neonatal nurse\npractitioner at 1532 hours. I discussed autopsy permission\nwith the parents. They have signed permission by telephone\nconsent for autopsy with no restrictions. That packet will be\ntaken to the Admission Office.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Death. The infant will be cremated\nas per parents' wishes at [**Hospital1 188**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], obstetrician, has been notified.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Cardiorespiratory failure secondary to\nextreme prematurity and possible pulmonary hypoplasia.\n\n\n\n                    DR.[**First Name (STitle) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] 50-ABP\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 56577**]\nMEDQUIST36\nD:  [**2109-12-17**] 19:48:22\nT:  [**2109-12-19**] 09:25:16\nJob#:  [**Job Number 59512**]\n\n    *discharge summary report ends*\n\n    Remember to output a single word, either YES or NO, as the answer.
